# pcp-zabbix-templates

There you can find templates to use with zabbix + pcp zabbix plugin.

## Notes:
* Those templates are tested only on Linux, with 3.0 zabbix-agent and server
* They are exported from zabbix 3.0 instance and might not work with older versions  
* I use grafana for graphs, so graphs in zabbix can be wrong (or just lacking)  
* I started using zabbix not so long ago, so some items might be just plain wrong
* And this is still work-in-progress, so use at your own risk.
